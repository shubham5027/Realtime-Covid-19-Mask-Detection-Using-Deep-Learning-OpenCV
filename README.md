## Introduction

In the midst of global health concerns, face mask detection has become a critical task for ensuring public safety and preventing the spread of contagious diseases. This project harnesses the power of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in conjunction with OpenCV to develop a highly accurate face mask detector.

## 📚 Dataset

We leverage the comprehensive data, which boasts over 100,00 diverse images of individuals with and without face masks. The dataset's wide range of lighting conditions, facial expressions, and backgrounds poses a challenging test for our face mask detection model.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

At the core of our face mask detection system lies a robust CNN, specifically the VGG16 architecture. CNNs excel at recognizing patterns and spatial relationships within images, making them ideal for this task. The VGG16 network is composed of a series of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, culminating in a binary classification output, indicating whether a face mask is present or not.

## 💻 OpenCV Implementation

We employ the versatile OpenCV library, renowned for its image processing and computer vision capabilities, to implement our face mask detection pipeline. OpenCV provides a comprehensive suite of functions for image manipulation, feature extraction, and object detection. Our pipeline consists of the following key steps:

* **Preprocessing:** Input images undergo resizing to a consistent size, followed by pixel value normalization to ensure data consistency.
* **Face Detection:** OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier plays a crucial role in identifying faces within the input image. It pinpoints regions likely to contain faces.
* **Feature Extraction:** The detected faces are then analyzed by the VGG16 CNN to extract distinctive features. These features encapsulate the essential characteristics of each face.
* **Classification:** A binary classifier, trained using the extracted features, determines whether a face mask is present. This classifier distinguishes between images with and without face masks.

## 🏃 Usage


Implementing face mask detection with our model is a straightforward process:

1. 💾 **Install Dependencies:** Ensure that OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras are installed in your environment.
2. 📥 **Acquire Model Weights:** Download the pre-trained model weights from our project repository.
3. 💻 **Load Model and Classifier:** Import the trained model and the Haar cascade classifier into your Python script.
4. 📸 **Load and Preprocess Image:** Load the input image and apply the necessary preprocessing steps.
5. 👀 **Detect Faces:** Utilize the Haar cascade classifier to identify faces within the image.
6. 🔎 **Extract Features:** Employ the VGG16 CNN to extract features from the detected faces.
7. ✅ **Classify Faces:** Use the trained binary classifier to classify each face as masked or unmasked.
8. 🎨 **Display Results:** Display the results by overlaying bounding boxes and labels on the input image.

## 💡 Additional Information

* Enhance the model's performance by fine-tuning it on a custom dataset tailored to your specific application.
* Experiment with data augmentation techniques to bolster the model's robustness and resilience.
